Road-Map:

Complete:
Clamp velocity of move to distance needed to reach target
limit AI outputs from effecting other team's players
Fix ball duplication and flightless ball buginess
Bulk simulation option
Visual difference between team members
Data drive AI module loading
Allow AI to set stats of players during simulation construction
Ball flight w/ throw 1 should be the only speed that can be outrun, and only by a run 3
Balls locked into play field with bounce
Players locked into play field
-draw_targets available to show player destinations
Frame rate adjusted to be more viewable
In flight balls made frame based instead of time based
Picking now has squared growth (IE pick chance per frame == 1/20, 4,20, 9/20) value to encourage high pick scores
Run now has root growth (IE runspeed == 1, 1.4, 1.7)
In flight balls now do line segment collision to prevent tunneling
